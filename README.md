Here is a commit of the actual http://www.mongotuto.com website (without the credentials
and images of course). MongoTuto aims to be the first French resource dealing with MongoDB including the whole official documentation translated into French with code examples (in various programming languages).

This is pretty much what I've done on my own. Nothing very technical,
a bit of Html/Css/Php/MongoDB and JavaScript, the hardest part was to translate the 700 pages
from the official MongoDB documentation.
